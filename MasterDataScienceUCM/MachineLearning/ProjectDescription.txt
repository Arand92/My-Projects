I worked on a machine learning project focused on predicting the functionality status of water pumps in Tanzania using data provided by Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. The goal was to classify each pump into one of three categories: functional, functional but in need of repair, or non-functional. By analyzing key features such as pump type, installation year, management structure, and other environmental and operational factors, the model aims to support proactive maintenance efforts and help ensure sustainable access to clean water for local communities.
